🚀 To test the lobby endpoints with a running server:

1. First, start a NATS server:
   docker run -p 4222:4222 nats:latest

2. Set up environment variables:
   export NATS_URLS="nats://localhost:4222"

3. Start the matchmaker HTTP service:
   cargo run --release

4. In another terminal, run the API test:
   ./test_lobby_api.sh

Expected results:
- GET /lobby/api/status should return max_rooms, active_rooms, total_rooms
- GET /lobby/api/rooms should return an empty array initially
- POST /lobby/api/rooms should create a new room and return room details
- POST /lobby/api/rooms/:id/start should mark a room as started
- POST /lobby/api/rooms/:id/leave should allow leaving a room

The lobby API endpoints are implemented and tested. The integration tests show 
that all core functionality works correctly:

✅ Create rooms with validation
✅ List active rooms (filters out started rooms)
✅ Get lobby status with room counts
✅ Start rooms (marks them as started)
✅ Leave rooms (removes players, deletes empty rooms)
✅ Handle not found errors properly
✅ Enforce room limits

The matchmaker lobby API endpoints are working correctly!
