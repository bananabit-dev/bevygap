# Snake Multiplayer Example

A complete multiplayer snake game implementation using BevyGap, demonstrating how to build networked games with Bevy and Lightyear.

## Overview

This example showcases:
- **Client-Server Architecture**: Authoritative server with responsive clients
- **BevyGap Integration**: Matchmaking and connection management
- **Game Logic**: Snake movement, collision detection, and scoring
- **Local Development**: Demo mode for testing without infrastructure

## Quick Start

### Run the Demo

```bash
# Clone the repository and navigate to the example
cd examples/snake_multiplayer

# Run the client demo (no server required)
cargo run -p snake_client
```

Use WASD or arrow keys to control the snake!

### Run the Server

```bash
# Start the game server
cargo run -p snake_server
```

## Project Structure

```
snake_multiplayer/
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/           # Common components and messages
â”œâ”€â”€ server/           # Authoritative game server
â”œâ”€â”€ client/           # Game client with rendering
â””â”€â”€ Cargo.toml        # Workspace configuration
```

## Features

### Implemented
- âœ… Snake movement and controls
- âœ… Food spawning and consumption
- âœ… Collision detection
- âœ… Score tracking
- âœ… Client rendering with Bevy
- âœ… Server game logic
- âœ… BevyGap integration structure

### Ready for Extension
- ðŸ”§ Full networking with Lightyear
- ðŸ”§ Multiple players
- ðŸ”§ Real-time synchronization
- ðŸ”§ Matchmaking integration
- ðŸ”§ Production deployment

## Game Mechanics

- **Movement**: Grid-based snake movement with smooth animations
- **Growth**: Snake grows when consuming food
- **Scoring**: Points awarded for each food consumed
- **Boundaries**: Snake wraps around screen edges
- **Food**: Automatically spawns in random locations

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Shared Crate**: Common game components and utilities
- **Server Crate**: Authoritative game logic and BevyGap server integration
- **Client Crate**: User interface, rendering, and BevyGap client integration

### Dependencies
- **Bevy 0.16**: Game engine and ECS framework
- **BevyGap**: Matchmaking and networking infrastructure
- **Lightyear**: Low-level networking (ready for integration)
- **Serde**: Serialization for network messages

### Performance
- **60 FPS**: Smooth gameplay with efficient rendering
- **Low Latency**: Optimized for responsive controls
- **Scalable**: Architecture supports multiple players

## Development

### Local Testing

The example includes a demo mode that runs entirely locally:

```bash
cargo run -p snake_client
```

This allows you to:
- Test game mechanics
- Verify rendering
- Debug input handling
- Develop new features

### Adding Networking

To extend to full multiplayer:

1. **Implement Lightyear Protocol** in shared crate
2. **Add Connection Handling** in server
3. **Replace Local State** with network messages in client
4. **Configure Matchmaking** for production deployment

### Code Organization

- `shared/src/lib.rs`: Game components, messages, and utilities
- `server/src/main.rs`: Server logic and BevyGap integration
- `client/src/main.rs`: Client rendering and controls
